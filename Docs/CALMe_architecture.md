# **CALMe** Trauma Response App - Architecture Document

## Executive Summary

### Hackathon Context: Israeli Population Resilience During War

This application addresses a critical gap in mental health support during active conflict situations in Israel. Traditional trauma response systems fail during emergencies when network infrastructure is compromised, emergency services are overwhelmed, and immediate professional help is unavailable.

**The Problem**: During rocket attacks, terror incidents, and ongoing conflict, civilians need immediate trauma support but face:
- Overwhelmed emergency mental health services
- Network outages preventing access to cloud-based apps
- Language barriers (Hebrew/English/Arabic populations)
- Panic responses that require natural language understanding, not rigid questionnaires
- Need for immediate coping mechanisms without waiting for professional intervention

**Our Solution**: A downloadable PWA that provides trauma-informed crisis support completely offline:
- **Natural language processing** understands panic responses like "אני לא יכול לנשום" (I can't breathe) or "everything is spinning"
- **Contextual therapeutic responses** guide users through safety assessment → stress management → cognitive recovery
- **True offline operation** works during network outages and infrastructure attacks
- **Culturally appropriate** with Hebrew/Arabic/English support and trauma-informed design
- **Shareable in crisis** - 50MB app transfers quickly via local networks or USB during emergencies

**Impact Potential**: Scales trauma support to entire population during mass casualty events, providing immediate psychological first aid when professional systems are overwhelmed.

## 3. Architectural Alternatives Analysis

### 3.1 Alternative 1: Native Mobile Apps

**Approach**: Separate iOS/Android native applications
**Why Rejected**:
- **App store dependencies**: Could be unavailable during infrastructure attacks
- **Platform fragmentation**: Requires separate development/maintenance for iOS/Android
- **Distribution complexity**: Cannot be shared peer-to-peer in emergency situations
- **Update dependencies**: Requires app store updates that may not reach users in crisis

**Trade-offs**: Native apps offer better performance and OS integration, but fail crisis availability requirements

### 3.2 Alternative 2: Server-Based Web Application

**Approach**: Traditional web app with server-side NLP processing
**Why Rejected**:
- **Network dependency**: Fails completely during infrastructure attacks
- **Single point of failure**: Server outages disable entire system during mass casualties
- **Scalability issues**: Cannot handle population-scale concurrent usage during crisis
- **Latency problems**: Network delays unacceptable during panic responses

**Trade-offs**: Server-based offers more sophisticated NLP but violates offline-first requirement

### 3.3 Alternative 3: Hybrid App with Cloud Fallback

**Approach**: Native app with local processing + cloud backup
**Why Rejected**:
- **Complexity**: Dual code paths increase failure points

    THERAPEUTIC --> CLASSIFY
    
    style PARSE fill:#e1f5fe
    style SEMANTIC fill:#e1f5fe
```

### 5.2 Conversation Flow Architecture

**Decision**: Finite State Machine with therapeutic routing
**Rationale**:
- Predictable conversation flow essential for crisis response
- Social worker input directly maps to state transitions
- Supports both classification (multiple choice) and extraction (open-ended) question types
- Allows for dynamic routing based on user safety status

**State Machine Architecture**:
```mermaid

    [*] --> SafetyCheck
    SafetyCheck --> LocationExtraction : SAFE
    SafetyCheck --> EmergencyMode : DANGER
    SafetyCheck --> SafetyClarification : UNSURE
    
    LocationExtraction --> StressAssessment : Complete
    LocationExtraction --> LocationClarification : Incomplete
    
    StressAssessment --> CalmingActivity : HIGH_STRESS
    StressAssessment --> CognitiveActivity : MODERATE_STRESS
    StressAssessment --> EventProcessing : LOW_STRESS
    
    CalmingActivity --> StressReassessment
    CognitiveActivity --> EventProcessing
    EventProcessing --> [*]
    
    EmergencyMode --> SafetyCheck : SAFETY_RESTORED
    EmergencyMode --> [*] : EMERGENCY_SERVICES
    
    SafetyClarification --> LocationExtraction : CLARIFIED_SAFE
    SafetyClarification --> EmergencyMode : CLARIFIED_DANGER
    LocationClarification --> StressAssessment : CLARIFIED_LOCATION
```

### 5.3 Offline Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Layered caching with Service Worker + IndexedDB
**Rationale**:
- Service Worker ensures resource availability during network outages
- IndexedDB provides structured storage for conversation history and user progress
- Cache API handles static assets (videos, images, conversation maps)
- localStorage for simple configuration and state persistence

**Storage Architecture**:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Cache Layers"
        SW[Service Worker Cache]
        HTTP[HTTP Cache]
        INDEXDB[IndexedDB]
        LOCAL[localStorage]
